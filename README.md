## Calendar App

Create a simple next.js or remix website where you can create a calendar that shows
public holidays based on a location. The user should be able to manually input their
location if access to their location isnâ€™t granted via the browser. The user should
then be able to select any year (past or present) and the site should generate a
calendar where the user can easily see the public holidays


## Requirements

 - Should use either Remix or Next.js for serving the frontend
 - Should have at least one unit test
 - Users should be able to select a country and a year and a full calendar as seen above should be displayed.
 - Holidays should be highlighted on the calendar.

## NTH

- Frontend written in Typescript
- Using Tailwind CSS + SASS for styling

## Resources

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
